This is a summary (or probably rather, a reformulation) of the 
script from ETH Zurich's class *Computational Statistis* from the 
seminar of statistics when it was taught by Martin Maechler. You can find 
the rendered version of this repo [here](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/comp_stats_summary/).
Pull requests are warmly welcomed, even if it's just typos.
